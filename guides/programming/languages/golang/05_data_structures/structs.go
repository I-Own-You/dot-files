// struct - typed collection fo fields, its useful for grouping data to form a record

type person struct {
	// in memory, the struct is just a contiguous block of memory which has its length for every filed like:
	// name will take 8 bytes (since my pc is 64 bit)
	// age will take 8 bytes (since my pc is 64 bit)
	// overall size of struct is 16 bytes, but because of alignment of memory it could take more.
	name string // field
	age  int    // field
	//
	// alignment - basically means filling the memory in blocks, for example you have
	//
	// doesItPass bool
	// truckRoad int32
	// overallRoad float64
	//
	// here, doesItPass needs 1 byte, but truckRoad needs 4 bytes, but overallRoad even 8 bytes,
	// it means, doesItPass will span over 8 bytes where 1 byte is his and the rest 7 is just filled, so that,
	// overallRoad could fit within this contiguous memory, and now the struct looks like this:
	//
	// doesItPass bool [1 byte]
	// [7 bytes padded]
	// truckRoad int32
	// [4 bytes padded]
	// overallRoad float64 [8 byte]
	// now, our struct has 32 bytes, it only matters when performance is really hurt, otherwise not.
	//
	// to fix this, you need to specify the fields from largest to smalles, like this:
	// overallRoad float64 [8 byte]
	// truckRoad int32 [4 bytes]
	// doesItPass bool [1 byte]
	// [3 bytes padded] // still needed becaus doesItPass has 1 byte, but it needs to align to truckRoad
	// but compiler can also do something else and need more or less so its kind of a hard topic.

	// you can also explicitly name the fields in any order, so not following the original struct sequence order
	fmt.Println(person{age: 30, name: "Alice"}) // the printing of a structs also follows struct sequence order

	// omitted fields will be zeroed within its type, age is int, so age = 0
	fmt.Println(person{name: "Fred"})

	// this way you can yield a pointer(address memmory) to the struct
	fmt.Println(&person{name: "Ann", age: 40})

	s := person{name: "Sean", age: 50}
	// this way you access its fields

	// meaing you can access the struct fields without using the (*s).fieldName syntax

	fmt.Println(sp.age) // no need for (*sp).age, but you can use it if you want

	// structs are mutable when referenced by memory, the s also changes because the sp hold a pointer to s
	// if it would be sp := s, sp would hove a copy of struct s, so different memory would mean they cant,
	// change each other, but if struct has a pointer field, the pointer fields will have a pointer copy,
	// so you can mutate data among all structs that are related.
	sp.age = 51
	fmt.Println(sp.age)

	// if a struct type is only used for a single value, we donâ€™t have to give it a name.
	// the value can have an anonymous struct type.
	//
	// also, you cant assign a struct to another struct even if they both are identical, but,
	// 1. you can if you convert them like struct1(struct2)
	// 2. assign an anonymous struct to it with identical structure (but better dont do this)
