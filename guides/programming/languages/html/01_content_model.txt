1. html tags are case insensitive,so <html> same as <HtML>, <htML>, .etc
2. most of elements are part of content categories (these group elements that share common characteristics)
    2.1 it doesnt bond any element, its just on words only but they help with understanding a gorup behaviour and rules
    2.2 it forms the content model of elements (what each element can take as a child), (for example <p> - should take phrases, <div> - flow content)
    2.3 there are 7 main content categroies:
        2.3.1 flow
            all elements that can go into <body> element, including hading, sectioning, phrasin, embedding, interactive and form relatd elements, 
            and also text nodes but those that have something beside whitespace in them,
            elements:
                <a> <abbr> <address> <article> <aside> <audio> <b> <bdi> <bdo> <blockquote> <br> <button> <canvas> 
                <cite> <code> <data> <datalist> <del> <details> <dfn> <dialog> <div> <dl> <em> <embed> <fieldset> <figure>
                <footer> <form> <h1>-<h6> <header> <hgroup> <hr> <i> <iframe> <img> <input> <ins> <kbd> <label> <main> <map>
                <mark> <math> <menu> <meter> <nav> <noscript> <object> <ol> <output> <p> <picture> <pre> <progress> <q>
                <ruby> <s> <samp> <script> <search> <section> <select> <slot> <small> <span> <strong> <sub> <sup> <svg>
                <table> <template> <textarea> <time> <u> <ul> <var> <video> <wbr> Autonomous custom elements and Plain text,
                and some elements that meet certain conditions:
                    <area>, if it is a descendant of a <map> element
                    <link>, if the itemprop attribute is present
                    <meta>, if the itemprop attribute is present
        2.3.2 heading
            subset of flow content, defines the title of the section, it applies to explicitly marked section elements or
            implicit ones like <h1>-<h6> and <hgroup>, it treats everything after <h1>Alo</h1> as section Alo,
            alos, <heading> can itself contain heading content, but is not, a heading itself
        2.3.3 sectioning
            subset of flow content, creates a section in the current outline(html starts a new part of the logical structure of the document),
            it also defines the scope of <header> and <footer> so if they are inside a section, then header/footer inside them are scoped to its article.
            elements:
                <article>, <aside>, <nav>, <section>
        2.3.4 metadata:
            modify the presentation or the behavior of the rest of the document, the <head> element includes:
            <title>, <link>, <script>, <style>, <meta>, <noscript>, <template>, <base>(rarely used), which is metadata content,
            some of them can be tied to more than 1 content category
        2.3.5 interactive
            subset of flow content, elements that are designed specifically for user interaction
            elements:
                <button> <details> <embed> <iframe> <label> <select> <textarea>,
                some elements taht meet specific criteria:
                        <a>, if the href attribute is present
                        <audio>, if the controls attribute is present
                        <img>, if the usemap attribute is present
                        <input>, if the type attribute is not in the hidden state
                        <object>, if the usemap attribute is present
                        <video>, if the controls attribute is present
        2.3.6 embedded
            subset of flow content, imports another resource or inserts anther content from another markup langauge or namespace
            elements:
                <audio> <canvas> <embed> <iframe> <img> <math> <object> <picture> <svg> <video>
        2.3.7 phrasing (this is the last one, below is mostly abstract)
            subset of flow content, refers to the text and markup within a document, sequences of these make up phrases.
            elements:
                <abbr> <audio> <b> <bdi> <bdo> <br> <button> <canvas> <cite> <code> <data> <datalist> <dfn> <em> <embed> <i>
                <iframe> <img> <input> <kbd> <label> <mark> <math> <meter> <noscript> <object> <output> <picture> <progress>
                <q> <ruby> <s> <samp> <script> <select> <slot> <small> <span> <strong> <sub> <sup> <svg> <template> <textarea>
                <time> <u> <var> <video> <wbr> Autonomous custom elements and Plain text,
                also elements that meet certain conditions:
                    <a>, if it contains only phrasing content
                    <area>, if it is a descendant of a <map> element
                    <del>, if it contains only phrasing content
                    <ins>, if it contains only phrasing content
                    <link>, if the itemprop attribute is present
                    <map>, if it contains only phrasing content
                    <meta>, if the itemprop attribute is present
        2.3.8 palpable
            content taht is not empty/hidden, the content is rendered and independent, such content doesnt define,
            content model, but a rule: elements taht can have any flow or phrasing content should have at least,
            one node that its palpable and doesnt have hidden attribute
            elements:
                <a> <abbr> <address> <article> <aside> <b> <bdi> <bdo> <blockquote> <button> <canvas> <cite> <code>
                <data> <del> <details> <dfn> <div> <em> <embed> <fieldset> <footer> <figure> <form> <iframe> <img>
                <ins> <kbd> <label> <main> <map> <mark> <math> <meter> <nav> <object> <p> <picture> <pre> <progress> <q>
                <ruby> <s> <samp> <search> <section> <select> <small> <span> <strong> <sub> <sup> <svg> <table>
                <textarea> <time> <u> <var> <video>
                Autonomous custom elements and Plain text that is not inter-element whitespace
                some elements taht meet criteria:
                    <audio>, if the controls attribute is present
                    <dl>, if the element's children include at least one name-value group
                    <input>, if the type attribute is not in the hidden state
                    <ol>, if it's children include at least one <li> element
                    <ul>, if it's children include at least one <li> element
        2.3.9 script supporting elements:
            they dont directly contribute to document rendering output, they serve to support script by,
            containing/specifying script code directly or by specifying data that will be used by scripts.
            most elements can contain script supporting elements
            elements:
                <script>
                <template>
        2.3.10 form-associated content:
            subset of flow content comprising elements that have a form owner and can be used everywhere flow content
            is expected.
            a form owner is <form> or <form> whose id is specified in the elements form attribute, so it means,
            that you either have a <form> with its content inside or a <form> maybe empty maybe partial empty,
            and its associated form fileds are somewhere else in the document but they have form attribute with,
            forms id.
            elements:
                <button> <fieldset> <input> <object> <output> <select> <textarea> <img> <label> <option> <meter> <progress>
            there are also sub categories:
                1. listed (they appear in .elements of <form>/<fieldset>):
                    <button>, <fieldset>, <input>, <object>, <output>, <select>, <textarea>
                2. submitable (its content is sent when form submits):
                    <button>, <input>, <select>, <textarea>
                3. resettable (its affected by a form reset):
                    <input>, <output>, <select>, <textarea>
                4. autocapitalize/autocorrect attribute (inherits these attributes from owner):
                    <button>, <fieldset>, <input>, <output>, <select>, <textarea>
                5. labelable (can be connected with a label):
                    <button>, <input> (except type="hidden"), <meter>, <output>, <progress>, <select>, <textarea>
        2.3.11 transparent content model:
            if an element is transparent content model, its content must be constructed in a valid html, even if 
            the transparent element were removed and replaced by the child elements.
            meaning:
                if you have ul wrapping <del> and it wrapping some <li> elements, then, if you remove <del>,
                it must result in a valid html anyway, so only <li> remains which is valid for <ul>
