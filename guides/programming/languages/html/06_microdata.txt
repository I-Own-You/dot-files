1. microdtaa - used to nest metadata within content on web pages
2. microdata can be exctracted and proccessed by search engines and web crawlers from a web page and use it to provide,
better brwoser experience for users.
3. search engines benefit from microdata by providing more relevant results to users by understand the information on a web page
4. microdtaa uses a supportive vocabularity to describe an item and name-value pairs to assign values to its properties:
    a group of name-value pairs -> groups are called items -> name-value pair is called a property -> items+properties called regular elements,
    to create an item, itemscope attribute is used,
    to add a property to an item, itemprop attribute is used on one of items descendants
5. microdata is a way of providing a declarative way of annotating HTML elements with machine-readable tags
6. global attributes:
    itemid - unique, global identifier of an item
    itemprop - add property of an item, every html element can have an itemprop attribute
    itemref - provides a list of elements ids(not itemid) with additional properties from the entire document,
              these properties must not be descendants of an element with the itemscope attribute
    itemscope - atteibute, usually with itemtype to speciy that html contained in a block is about a particular item.
                creates the Item and defines the scope of the itemtype associated with.
                its also a valid URL of a vocabulary(ex: schema.org) that describes the item and its properties context
    itemtype - specifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to define itemprop's in the data structure.

schema.org is a popular vocabular for this case which most search engines rely on.
