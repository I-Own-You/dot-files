microformats:
    1. standards used to embed semantics and structured data in HTML,
        and provide an API to be used by social web applications, search engines, aggregators, and other tools.
    2. these minimal patterns of HTML are used for marking up entities that range from fundamental to
        domain-specific information, such as people, organizations, events, and locations.

To create a microformats object, h-* class names are used in the class attribute.
To add a property to an object, the p-*, u-*, dt-*, e-* class names are used on one of the object's descendants.

Microformats use supporting vocabularies to describe objects and name-value pairs to assign values to their properties.

The properties are carried in class attributes that can be added to any HTML element,
while the data values re-use HTML element content and semantic attributes.

how microformats work:
    <a class="h-card" href="https://alice.example.com">Alice Blogger</a>
    1. when a parser encounters this data,
       it will know that this page contains a "card" which describes a person or organization named Alice Blogger with
       a URL of https://alice.example.com/, parser makes this data available via APIs that can be used for different applications
       and an application could scan a page for a h-card to use as profile information for someone who has signed up to a service.
