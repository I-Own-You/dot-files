data attributes - helps with associating some data with an element that has no meaning, stored on html elements as attributes,
                  data-*
        <main>
        <article
            id="electric-cars"
            data-columns="3" 
            data-index-number="12314"
            data-parent="cars">
            <!-- Electric car content -->
        </article>
        </main>

1. you can read data-* values with js
2. you can get data-* vlues inside css or use them as css selectors
3. data-* are bad for accessibility if the info is important and its meaning was to be on document rendered
