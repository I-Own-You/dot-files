Concurrency:
1. Definition:
      Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks
      or processes at the same time by interleaving their execution.
      It is about dealing with lots of things at once, but not necessarily executing them simultaneously.
2. Goal:
      The main goal of concurrency is to manage multiple tasks efficiently,
      which may involve task switching or time-sharing.
3. Example:
      A single-core CPU running multiple threads or processes where each task is given a slice of time to execute.
      For instance, a web server handling multiple requests by switching between them,
      even if only one request is being processed at a time.

Parallelism: 
1. Definition:
      Parallelism refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes.
      It involves executing multiple operations at the same time, typically on multiple cores or processors.
2. Goal:
      The main goal of parallelism is to speed up processing
      by leveraging multiple processing units to perform tasks simultaneously.
3. Example:
      A multi-core CPU executing multiple threads or processes at the exact same time.
      For example, a video rendering application using all available cores
      to process different parts of the video simultaneously.

Key Differences:
  1. Execution:
      1. Concurrency:
          Tasks may be interleaved or managed in a way that gives the illusion of simultaneous execution.
          It's about managing multiple tasks, but not necessarily executing them at the same time.
      2. Parallelism:
          Tasks are actually executed simultaneously, leveraging multiple processing units.
  2.Hardware Utilization:
      1. Concurrency:
          Can be achieved on a single-core CPU by rapidly switching between tasks.
          It does not require multiple processors or cores.
      2. Parallelism:
          Requires multiple cores or processors to execute tasks simultaneously.
  3. Scope:
      1. Concurrency:
          Applies to task management and scheduling,
          ensuring that multiple tasks can be handled effectively over time.
      2. Parallelism:
          Applies to actual simultaneous execution of tasks,
          focusing on performance improvement through concurrent execution.

Example Scenarios:
    1. Concurrency Example:
        An online ticket booking system where multiple users are booking tickets at the same time.
        The system handles multiple booking requests by interleaving their processing,
        ensuring that each request gets handled in an efficient manner.
    2. Parallelism Example:
        A scientific computation application that performs calculations on large datasets,
        using multiple CPU cores to process different parts of the dataset simultaneously.

Integration:
    Many modern systems use both concurrency and parallelism.
    For instance, a web server might handle multiple incoming requests concurrently and,
    within each request, perform parallel computations to improve performance.
