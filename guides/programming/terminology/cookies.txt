Cookies: small pieces of data stored on the client (browser) by the server.
         persist on the client and are sent automatically with requests to the same domain.
Purpose: used to maintain state across requests (e.g., sessions, preferences).

How They Work:
    1. server sends a Set-Cookie header in the response.
    2. browser stores the cookie and includes it in future requests to the same domain via the Cookie header.

Example:
Server response:
    Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly
Client request:
    Cookie: session_id=abc123
