IPv4:
  1. addresses consist of two things: (network address and host address)
  2. stands for Internet Protocol version four.
  3. was introduced in 1981 by DARPA.
  4. was the first deployed version in 1982 for production on SATNET and on the ARPANET in January 1983.
  5. is 32-bit integers length that have to be expressed in decimal notation.
  6. it is represented by 4 numbers separated by dots in the range of 0-255,
     which have to be converted to 0 and 1, to be understood by computers, example: 189.123.123.90

drawbacks of IPv4:
  1. limited address space:
    IPv4 has a limited number of addresses,
    which is not enough for the growing number of devices connecting to the internet.
    
  2. complex configuration:
    IPv4 often requires manual configuration or DHCP to assign addresses,
    which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
    
  3. less efficient routing:
    The IPv4 header is more complex, which can slow down data processing and routing.
    
  4. security issues:
    IPv4 does not have built-in security features,
    making it more vulnerable to attacks unless extra security measures are added.
  
  5. limited support for quality of service (QoS):
    IPv4 has limited capabilities for prioritizing certain types of data,
    which can affect the performance of real-time applications like video streaming and VoIP.
    
  6. fragmentation:
    IPv4 allows routers to fragment packets,
    which can lead to inefficiencies and increased chances of data being lost or corrupted.
    
  7. broadcasting overhead:
    IPv4 uses broadcasting to communicate with multiple devices on a network,
    which can create unnecessary network traffic and reduce performance.


IPv6:
  1. based on IPv4 and stands for Internet Protocol version 6.
  2. was first introduced in December 1995 by Internet Engineering Task Force.
  3. new version of Internet Protocol, better than IPv4 in terms of complexity and efficiency.
  4. is written as a group of 8 hexadecimal numbers separated by colon (:).
  5. it can be written as 128 bits of 0s and 1s. 
  6. example: ABCD:EF01:2345:6789:ABCD:B201:5482:D023

benefits of IPv6:
  1. larger address space:
    IPv6 has a greater address space than IPv4, which is required for expanding the IP Connected Devices.
    IPv6 has 128 bit IP Address rather and IPv4 has a 32-bit Address.
    
  2. improved security:
    IPv6 has some improved security which is built in with it.
    IPv6 offers security like Data Authentication, Data Encryption, etc.
    Here, an Internet Connection is more Secure.
    
  3. simplified header format:
      As compared to IPv4, IPv6 has a simpler and more effective header Structure,
      which is more cost-effective and also increases the speed of Internet Connection.
      
  4. prioritize:
    IPv6 contains stronger and more reliable support for QoS features,
    which helps in increasing traffic over websites and increases audio and video quality on pages.
    
  5. improved support for mobile devices:
    IPv6 has increased and better support for Mobile Devices.
    It helps in making quick connections over other Mobile Devices and in a safer way than IPv4.

switching from IPv4 to IPv6:
  1. dual stacking:
    Devices can use both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time.
    This way, they can talk to networks and devices using either version.
    
  2. tunneling:
    This method allows IPv6 users to send data through an IPv4 network to reach other IPv6 users.
    Think of it as creating a “tunnel” for IPv6 traffic through the older IPv4 system.
    
  3. network address translation (NAT):
    NAT helps devices using different versions of IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
    to communicate with each other by translating the addresses so they understand each other.


differences between IPv4 and IPv6:
  1.  IPv4 has a 32-bit address length                                                                              1. IPv6 has a 128-bit address length
  2.  It Supports Manual and DHCP address configuration                                                             2. It supports Auto and renumbering address configuration
