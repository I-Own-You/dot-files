mutual exclusion:
                  is a property of concurrency control,
                  which is instituted for the purpose of preventing race conditions.
                  
                  It is the requirement that one thread of execution never enters a critical section while,
                  a concurrent thread of execution is already accessing said critical section,
                  which refers to an interval of time during which a thread of execution accesses,
                  a shared resource or shared memory.
