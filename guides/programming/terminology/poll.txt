Poll:
      typically refers to a method or system call used to monitor multiple file descriptors like
      sockets, pipes, or other input/output sources, to see if they are ready for some kind of I/O operation like
      reading or writing. Polling is commonly used in event-driven programming.

1.System Call (poll/select):
                             In Unix-like operating systems, poll() or select() is a system call
                             that allows a program to monitor multiple file descriptors at once and
                             determine which ones are ready for I/O operations.
                             It helps manage multiple connections or streams of data without blocking on
                             a single one.

2. Polling in Event Loops:
                          Polling can refer to periodically checking a condition or resource.
                          For example, in an event loop, a program might poll for new events or
                          data at regular intervals.
                          
3. Polling in Networking:
                          In networking, polling may refer to repeatedly checking the status of a
                          network connection or device to determine if thereâ€™s incoming data or
                          if the connection is still alive.
                            
4. Polling in Software:
                        Sometimes used more generally, "polling" refers to repeatedly checking the
                        status of something (like polling a server for updates) rather than
                        waiting for the server to push updates.
