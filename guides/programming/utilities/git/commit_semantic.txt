login page:
1. if user inputs incorrect credentials, display errors below each input field
2. on success login, redirect to user account
3. if user tries to login with socials:
   1. error occurs: display it above login button
   2. no error: redirect user to user account
4. if user clicks the "reset password" link, its redirected to reset password page:
   1. on reset password page, if entered email is:
      1. valid: an email is sent at that email with password inside
      2. invalid: error is displayed above submit button

register page:
1. if user inputs incorrect credentials, display errors below each input field
2. on success register:
   1. redirect user to login page with a text above email field, that we have sent an email to verify the account
   2. system sends an email with a link inside which verifies the created user account and
      redirects user to login page where a text above email field that account has beend activiated
3. if user tries to register with socials:
   1. error: display it above register button
   2. no error: redirect user to user account

order logic:
1. if user clicks on cart on a menu to command it:
   1. menu has additives: a modal with menu is opened so user can choose them and then click on the buy button
   2. menu doesnt have additives: menu goes to the cart without displaying modal
2. if user successfuly added an item to cart, a modal should display a text that menu has been added.
3. cart should update the state (counter) if it added a menu or deleted or updated (both on the navbar and on the right corner (icon))
4. when user makes a command on cart page 
5. on order page:
   1. user logged in: contacts section is populated with user data from its account
   2. user not logged in: user inputs credentials:
      1. errors must be under the input line, line itself becomes red as text error
   
6. when user selects "self delivery" on "delivery" section:
   1. date selector should be for 2 weeks, so there will be 14 options starting from today
   2. time selector should display time starting from now with 15 minutes step, if now is 19:26, then it start from 19:30, 19:45, .etc till 22:45(since it closes on 23:00), (opens it on 9:00, so delivery should start from 9:30(in case someone orders in the morning))

user account/personal data:
1. changing the password involves checking the old one which means you need:
   1. make user input both old password
   2. make user input new password and repeat new password:
      1. check on the frontend if passwords are identic
   3. send both old + new password + repeated new password:
      1. check if old password is right: if not, send a response saying old password is wrong
      2. check if new password is good(validate): if not, send a response error
      3. check if repeated password is same as new password:
         1. if not, send a response error
this is needed so you wont make 2 request for checkinf old password and then checking new password

menu card modal:
1. if user make modifications on modal(adding sauce or adding additives):
   1. on exit: state resets
   2. additives that were chosen and state upated(through counter) should persist if
      user changes the additive and goes back
