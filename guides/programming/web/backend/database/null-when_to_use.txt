When to use:

1. Represents Missing or Unknown Data (
    NULL is a powerful concept for representing missing, unknown, or inapplicable data
):
    1. Optional Fields:
        In cases where some data is optional,
        a NULL value can be used to indicate that the value is not provided,
        rather than using a default or placeholder value that might be misleading
        (e.g., using 0 for a phone number or an empty string for a name).
    2. Unknown Values:
        If you don't know a value yet (e.g., a user's birthdate or address),
        using NULL is semantically correct.
        It tells you that the data is not yet available,
        which is better than using a default value like "Unknown" or "N/A".
    3. Inapplicable Data:
        For some fields, the value might not apply to all rows.
        For instance, a "spouse" field might be NULL for single people.
        This is more meaningful than using a placeholder value like "None" or "Not applicable."

2. Flexibility in Schema Design (
    NULL values provide flexibility in your database schema, especially when dealing with:
):
    1. Sparse Data:
        When not all records have the same attributes,
        NULL allows you to leave fields empty rather than forcing a meaningless value.
        For example,
        a table that tracks user preferences might have many optional fields that can be NULL if not set.
    2. Normalization:
        In normalized schemas,
        NULL values can be used to indicate that certain fields are optional or
        that certain relationships don't exist for all records.
        This can reduce redundancy and allow for a more flexible data model.

3. Efficient Storage for Optional Data (
    Using NULL for optional data is often more efficient than
    using placeholder values (like an empty string or 0).
    Storing a NULL value typically uses less storage space than storing a placeholder value,
    especially for large text or numerical fields.
)

4. Better Data Integrity (
    By using NULL, you explicitly show that a field is not filled in,
    as opposed to using a default value that might conflict with valid data.
    For example, if you use 0 to represent a missing value in a "price" field,
    it's not clear whether 0 means the item is free or the price is unknown.
    Using NULL avoids this ambiguity.
)

5. SQL Features for NULL (
    SQL has built-in features that allow you to handle NULL values in a flexible way
)
    1. IS NULL / IS NOT NULL: These operators are used to filter out NULL values when needed.
    2. COALESCE():
        This function returns the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions,
        which is useful for handling NULL in queries.
    3. NULLIF(): 
        This function returns NULL if two expressions are equal,
        which can be useful for avoiding specific values like 0 or empty strings.

6. Clearer Logic and Intent (
    Using NULL can make your database schema and queries clearer.
    When you see a NULL value, it clearly indicates that something is missing or unknown,
    whereas using a placeholder value might make it harder to distinguish between actual data and missing data.
)

When not to use:
    1. If the data is required:
        If a field must always have a value (e.g., email address, primary key),
        then it should not be NULL.
        Instead, enforce constraints like NOT NULL to ensure data integrity.
    2. If it complicates queries:
        Sometimes, NULL values can complicate queries, especially when aggregating data.
        For example, calculating averages or sums can be trickier when NULL values are present.
        However, SQL provides functions like COUNT() and SUM() that can handle NULL values correctly.
    3. If default values are more appropriate:
        In some cases, a default value (e.g., an empty string or 0) might be more meaningful than NULL,
        especially if itâ€™s clear that the value is not applicable or not yet set.
