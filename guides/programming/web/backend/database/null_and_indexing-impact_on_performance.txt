NULL fields can have an impact on performance,
especially when it comes to indexing and query performance:

    1. Indexing and Null Values: (
        Indexes are typically created on columns that are frequently queried,
        When a column contains many NULL values, it can affect the efficiency of the index in the following ways
    ):
        1. Space Usage:
            Indexes that include NULL values take up more space because the database needs to store information
            about the NULL values in the index.
            This can increase the size of the index, making it less efficient.
        2. Index Selectivity:
            An index is most useful when it has high "selectivity"
            meaning that the values in the indexed column are unique or have a wide distribution.
            If a large portion of the column contains NULL values, the index becomes less selective,
            and the database might not use the index as effectively for query optimization.
        3. Performance Degradation:
            Queries that involve NULL values can be slower because the database has to handle them specially.
            For example,
            filtering or searching for NULL values can be less efficient than searching for non-NULL values.

    2. Query Performance (
        When you have a column with many NULL values and that column is indexed,
        the database might perform unnecessary work to handle those NULL values
    ):
        1. If you're querying a column with a condition like column = NULL,
        the database must evaluate each row to determine if the column is NULL,
        which is less efficient than checking for a specific value.
        2. When joining tables on columns with many NULL values, the join might become less efficient,
        as the database has to consider how to handle the NULL values in the join condition.

    3. Impact on Storage and Query Plans
        1. Storage:
            NULL values increase the storage requirements of the database,
            as each NULL must be stored in the index and data pages.
        2. Query Plans:
            Databases might generate less efficient query plans when dealing with NULL values.
            For example,
            checking for NULL values in queries (e.g., column IS NULL) can result in slower execution plans
            compared to queries that check for specific values.



Optimization Techniques:
    1. Avoid Indexing Nullable Columns:
        If a column is mostly NULL, you might want to avoid indexing it.
        Instead, you can index only the columns that are frequently queried and contain meaningful data.
    2. Partial Indexes:
        In some databases, you can create a partial index that only includes rows where the column is not NULL.
        This way, the index only covers the rows with meaningful data, improving its selectivity and performance.
    3. Default Values:
        Instead of allowing NULL,
        you could set a default value for the column (e.g., an empty string or a specific placeholder).
        This avoids the overhead of handling NULL values and can improve performance,
        but it might not always be suitable depending on the use case.
