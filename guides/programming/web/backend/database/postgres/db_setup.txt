installation:
    1. choose the version
    2. install using macos/windows/linux guides.
        2.1. paru postgresql
        2.2. sudo -u postgres initdb -D /var/lib/postgres/data
        2.2.1. (in case theres an error like cant create folder)
            sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/postgres
            sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgres
        2.3 systemctl start postgresql.service | systemctl enabled postgresql.service

configuration:
    1. create the database
        1.1 psql -U postgres (if user not created yet) | psql [user_name]
        1.2 create database 'database';
        1.3 assign a user owner for database (if created by different user)
        1.4 modify any other options for db as you need (locale, encoding, timezone, .etc)
    2. set user roles (if needed) / configure users
        2.1 create user 'user' with password 'password';
        2.2 grant needed priviliges for user
        2.3 modify user as you need 
    3. adjust settings in postgresql.conf file (if needed)
    4. adjust settings in pg_hba.conf file (if needed)

security:
    1. keep regular updates that fix vulnerabilities/bugs
    2. implement authentication/authorization methods (ex: SSL certificate / password policies / .etc)
    3. assign permissions based on user roles(RBCA) (if needed)
    4. encrypt data/db while resting/transit (if needed)
    5. adjust settings in postgresql.conf file (if needed)
    6. restrict file system permissions (like directory permissions, deletion, .etc) where postgres files relie
    7. log information to analyze (like connections, errors, .etc)

performance optimization:
    1. index fields that are often queried
    2. analyze queries with EXPLAIN sql command to modify for better results
    3. implement connection pooling to manage db connetions
    4. adjust settings in postgresql.conf file (if needed)
    5. modify parameters in shared_buffers and work_mem (if needed)

backup/recovery:
    1. schedule regular backups with tools like pg_dump/pg_restore, .etc
    2. setup write-ahead logging for point-in-time recovery capabilities

monitoring/maintenance:
    1. use tools like pg_stat_statments or 3rd party solutions to monitor db performance
    2. vacuuming, analyzing, reindexing to mainain db health
